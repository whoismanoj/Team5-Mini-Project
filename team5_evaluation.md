My observations:
  - Problem Formulation: It's a trivial one. Good!
  - Data cleaning: Good work; Merging different datasets together to address the problem.
  - EDA: Good with Geolocation and many more!
  - Machine Learning: Linear regression, ordinary least squares. But it is not clear that why this technique is used to address the problem. Neural Network is designed and developed.
  - Something New: Tensorflow
